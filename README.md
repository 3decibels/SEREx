# SEREx

SEREx is the **S**imple **E**ngine for **R**egular **Ex**pressions. It is an Elixir implementation of Rob Pike's compact regex engine discussed in Brian Kernighan's [A Regular Expression Matcher](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html).

This project was an interesting exercise in converting a small C program that takes advantage of pointers into Elixir to examine the trade-offs in approach.
